# Decision: Use Separate Events for Scene and Recognized Objects

## Context
- Designing a system for a robotic brain that processes visual information over time.
- Events are needed to represent changes in the scene and recognized objects.

## Decision
- Use two separate events for scene information and recognized objects: "what\_i\_see" and "recognized\_object".
- Include image payloads for each event to provide visual context.

## Reasons
1. **Efficient processing:** Separate events allow for targeted updates to the scene or recognized objects, simplifying processing logic.
2. **Clear distinction:** Maintaining distinct events clarifies the purpose of each and helps avoid potential confusion.
3. **Manageable payloads:** Keeping events focused reduces complexity and potential size issues, ensuring efficient use of resources.

## Alternatives Considered
- A single event containing both scene information and recognized objects was considered but was found to be less efficient and potentially more complex.

## Impact
- The system will require logic to handle two different event types but will benefit from clearer, more manageable events.
- Future enhancements to scene processing or object recognition can be more easily accommodated with this approach.

## Payloads
**what i see** event:
```json
{
    "event_type": "what_i_see",
    "timestamp": "2023-03-27T14:30:00Z",
    "data": {
        "objects": ["person", "car", "tree"],
        "scene": "outdoor",
        "image_payload": "base64_encoded_image_string"
    }
}
```

**recognized object** event:
```json
{
    "event_type": "recognized_object",
    "timestamp": "2023-03-27T14:30:00Z",
    "data": {
        "object_type": "person",
        "object_id": "12345",
        "object_name": "Jane Doe",
        "confidence": 0.95,
        "image_payload": "base64_encoded_image_string"
    }
}
```
